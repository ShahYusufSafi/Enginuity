# Enginuity Cloud Solver

**Enginuity** is a cloud-based engineering platform designed to bring CAD, simulation, and computational solvers together ‚Äî **no external software required**.  
Upload your CAD file, visualize it, and run solvers directly in the browser.

## Features

‚úÖ **User Authentication** ‚Äì Secure sign-in using Clerk services.  
‚úÖ **Dashboard** ‚Äì Upload your CAD files and visualize them as SVGs.  
‚úÖ **1D FEM Solver (Demo)** ‚Äì Proof-of-concept solver that demonstrates working finite element analysis.  
‚úÖ **Theme Switching** ‚Äì Toggle between light and dark themes.  
‚úÖ **Drawing Page** ‚Äì Draw and measure geometry interactively (prototype).  
‚úÖ **Simulation Page** ‚Äì Placeholder for advanced computational solvers (FEM / PINN).
